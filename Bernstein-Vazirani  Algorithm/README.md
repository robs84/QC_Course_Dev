   Numbers can be stored as bits, just as any character can.  For integers, the conversion to binary involves dividing by two and recording the remainder.  The remainder values are written in reverse order, or right to left.  For example, the number 45 can be stored as the six-digit bitwise number 101101.
   Consider a box and we store a bit-wise number inside.  The box is only accessible via an oracle.  If we make a guess at one or more digits of the number stored within, the oracle will reveal whether we guessed correctly or not.  The oracle will not reveal full details about the number directly, nor can we see inside the box.  Only by guessing correctly will the number be revealed.  Naively, we could start with zero and guess every permutation of ones and zeroes until we get the right answer.  
   Perhaps a more strategic response on a classical computer would be to use the AND operation to bit-wise solve for the full number.  An AND operation is simply when the compared bit is a 1 it returns a 1, otherwise it returns a 0.  Using this method each bit only needs to be tested once, so to resolve the secret N-digit bit-wise number we would need N attempts.  For example, this method would reveal our binary 45 in six attempts.  In quantum computing, application of the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm can successfully guess the secret number in just 1 attempt through qubit entanglement, regardless of the size of the bit-wise number.
