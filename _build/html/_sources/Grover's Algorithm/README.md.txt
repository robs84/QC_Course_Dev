It is often advantageous in computing to search through a dictionary containing any number of strings, integers, etc. An example of this might be to search through a list of flight routes to find the one that will get you to your destination soonest.  In this example, if there are $N$ possible flights plans, the amount of operations needed is $O(N)$ to perform an unstructured search. However, by employing Grover's algorithm the search speeds up quadratically.  Grover's algorithm is an efficient search method that amplifies a target state through the use of an Oracle (like we saw in previous modules) and a phase shift. In this module you will guided in writing an implementation of Grover's algorithm in Qiskit.  Details about Grover's algorithm can be found in the following resource:
