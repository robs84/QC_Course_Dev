Begin by installing Qiskit in your preferred manner by following the instructions provided here:
https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html

Now that you've installed Qiskit to your local machine, let's start familiarizing ourselves with it!  

There are two modules that will briefly demonstrate visualization and simulation of quantum circuits using Qiskit.  You are highly encouraged to delve deeper into Qiskit as your schedule permits, which will help you with coding later in the semester.  Below, please find a brief description of these modules, and each module includes some conceptual questions to answer.  Understanding Dirac notation will be helpful, but not entirely necessary.  Anyone who has no experience with such notation can let me know and we will work out a tutorial session.
