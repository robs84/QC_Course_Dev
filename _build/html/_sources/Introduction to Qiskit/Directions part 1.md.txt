In this module we will look at both superposition and entanglement using the Hadamard and CNOT gates. The learning objective is to gain an intuition about these fundamental operations.

Begin by generating a quantum circuit composed of a 2-qubit quantum register
and a 2-bit classical register.

To the first qubit apply a Hadamard gate and then apply a controlled X gate
between the two qubits.  Measure both qubits and comment on the results.

Now, repeat the process with a second Hadamard on the first qubit before the CNOT and again after the CNOT. Comment on what happens in both scenarios. This logic can be worked out somewhat trivially using Dirac notation.
